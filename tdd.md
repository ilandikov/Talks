I am a passionate developer with over a decade of IT experience since 2012. I have been a developer, project engineer and tech sales and then came back to developing because this is the activity I love. I'm interested in state-of-the-art methodologies for development like Behaviour- and Test-Driven Development and Pair Programming.

I'm also a tango dancer, DJ, organiser and teacher.<!-- endInclude -->
