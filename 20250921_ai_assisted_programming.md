I am a passionate developer with over a decade of IT experience since 2012. I have been a developer, project engineer and tech sales and then came back to developing because this is the activity I love. I'm interested in state-of-the-art methodologies for development like Behaviour- and Test-Driven Development.

Contributor to [obsidian-tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) - a task management plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

I'm also a tango organiser, dancer and DJ.<!-- endInclude -->
